```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your deployed website URL
```

### 3. Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### 4. Run Specific Test Suites
```bash
# API tests only
npx playwright test api.spec.ts

# Frontend tests only
npx playwright test frontend.spec.ts

# Integration tests only
npx playwright test integration.spec.ts

# Accessibility tests only
npx playwright test accessibility.spec.ts

npx playwright test performance.spec.ts
```

## üîß Test Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# Your deployed website URL (required)
BASE_URL=https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod

# Optional performance thresholds
MAX_PAGE_LOAD_TIME=5000
MAX_API_RESPONSE_TIME=3000
MAX_SEARCH_TIME=1000
```

### Browser Configuration
Tests run on multiple browsers by default:
- **Desktop**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile**: Chrome Mobile, Safari Mobile

### Test Modes
```bash
# Run with browser UI visible
npm run test:headed

# Run in debug mode
npm run test:debug

4. Add to test suite documentation

### Custom Matchers
```typescript
// Example custom matcher for coach data validation
expect(coach).toHaveValidCoachStructure();
```

### Test Data Management
```typescript
// Create test coaches for specific scenarios
const testCoach = {
  name: 'Test Coach',
  specialty: 'Test Specialty',
  location: 'Test City',
  // ... other properties
};
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests Timeout**
   - Check BASE_URL is correct
   - Verify website is deployed and accessible
   - Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts

2. **API Tests Fail**
   - Verify API endpoints are working
   - Check CORS configuration
   - Validate request/response formats

3. **Browser Installation**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   npx playwright install-deps
   ```

4. **Environment Issues**
   - Verify .env file exists and has correct BASE_URL
   - Check network connectivity to deployed site

### Getting Help
- Check test logs in `test-results/`
- Review HTML report for detailed failure information
- Use debug mode to step through failing tests
- Verify website is accessible manually before running tests
